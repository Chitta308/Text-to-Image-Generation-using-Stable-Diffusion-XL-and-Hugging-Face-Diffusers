## 🚀 Project Showcase: Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion XL
I'm excited to share my latest project where I explored the power of Generative AI by creating a Text-to-Image generation model using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) from Hugging Face. 🎨🤖

## 🔍 What I did:

Used stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 to generate high-resolution images from text prompts.

Built the model pipeline using 🤗 diffusers, transformers, and accelerate libraries.

Enabled efficient memory usage with torch.float16 and GPU acceleration.

Prompted creative visuals like: "An astronaut riding a green horse" 🐎👨‍🚀

## ✅ Skills Applied:

Generative AI

Diffusion Models

Hugging Face ecosystem

PyTorch & GPU optimization

🧠 This project strengthened my understanding of how text and vision models can work together to generate stunning, AI-powered art.

📸 Stay tuned — more visual demos and projects are coming!
